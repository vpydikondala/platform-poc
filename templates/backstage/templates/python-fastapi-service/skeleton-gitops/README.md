# GitOps manifests for {{ name }}

These files are generated by Backstage and committed to the `env-gitops` repository.

They create:
- `{{ name }}-dev` Argo CD Application (apps-dev namespace)
- `{{ name }}-prod` Argo CD Application (apps-prod namespace)

The Application references the service Helm chart in the service repository and
loads environment-specific values from env-gitops.

Once merged into env-gitops:
- Argo CD continuously reconciles and deploys the service into AKS
